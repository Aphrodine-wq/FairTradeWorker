# FairTradeWorker: Revenue Model Correction Summary

**Date:** January 4, 2026
**Change Type:** Critical Revenue Model Update
**Status:** CORRECTED ✅

---

## What Was Changed

The initial pricing strategy incorrectly modeled platform fees as **18% deducted from contractor earnings**. This has been corrected to charge **12-15% platform fees to HOMEOWNERS** instead, with **contractors receiving 100% of their bid amounts**.

---

## The Correction

### BEFORE (INCORRECT)
```
Homeowner pays contractor:    $5,000
Platform fee (18%):           $900  ← TAKEN FROM CONTRACTOR
Contractor receives:          $4,100
Platform revenue:             $900
```

**Problem:** This heavily undercuts contractor value proposition and creates friction

---

### AFTER (CORRECT)
```
Homeowner's job budget:       $5,000
Platform fee (12%):           $600  ← PAID BY HOMEOWNER
Homeowner pays total:         $5,600
Contractor bid amount:        $5,000
Contractor receives:          $5,000 (100% - NO DEDUCTION!)
Platform revenue:             $600
```

**Advantage:**
- Contractors see full job value (higher bid conversion)
- Contractors keep 100% of earnings (better margins than competitors)
- Homeowners pay upfront fee (transparent pricing)
- Platform gets clean revenue without contractor friction

## Financial Impact

### Year 1 Revenue Projections (UPDATED)

| Scenario | Before | After | Change |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Conservative | $11.2M | $4.3M | -61% |
| Moderate | $11.2M | $8.7M | -22% |
| Optimistic | $11.2M | $9.2M | -18% |

**Note:** "Before" assumed unrealistic 18% contractor deductions across all 1000 monthly contracts at full volume. "After" is more realistic with homeowner adoption curves.

### Gross Margins (MAINTAINED)

| Scenario | Before | After | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Conservative | 74.1% | 70.6% | ✅ Still excellent |
| Moderate | 74.1% | 70.6% | ✅ Still excellent |
| Optimistic | 74.1% | 70.8% | ✅ Still excellent |

**Conclusion:** Business model is actually HEALTHIER with homeowner fees. Maintains 70%+ margins while being more contractor-friendly.
