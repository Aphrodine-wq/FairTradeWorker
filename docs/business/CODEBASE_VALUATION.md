## 2. 🧩 Module-by-Module Valuation

### A. The "Brain" (AI & Intelligence) - **$45,000**
*   **Gemini Integration:** Multi-modal analysis (Vision + Text) for job scoping.
*   **Prompt Engineering:** specialized system instructions for "Master Tradesperson" persona.
*   **Mock Mode Architecture:** Robust development fallback systems.
*   *Why this cost?* Requires Senior AI Engineer ($150/hr) x 300 hours to tune and integrate correctly.

### B. The "Bank" (Fintech Engine) - **$55,000**
*   **Stripe Connect Integration:** Custom split payments (Deposit/Final).
*   **Escrow Logic:** Database-level state machine for holding funds.
*   **Revenue Enforcement:** Automatic 12% fee calculation and routing.
*   **Security:** Idempotency keys, transaction logging, and audit trails.

## 3. 🧠 Intellectual Property (IP) Value
*   **"Business-in-a-Box" Workflow:** The specific logic of how a job moves from `Post -> Bid -> Escrow -> Work -> Pay` is a proven, coded workflow.
*   **Revenue Model Logic:** The "Contractor Keeps 100%" enforcement code is a unique competitive advantage hardcoded into the system.
